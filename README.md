# Design Prototype
Our prototype is focused on exploring several aspects of the Game Gear handheld: first, how can we recreate the Z80 processor on an FPGA and run assembly code to test and validate that it is functioning properly. In addition, how can we create test ROM files for the Game Gear that can run in an emulator and eventually be used on the hardware FPGA implementation. Each aspect of the project is linked below:
- [FPGA Implementation](A-Z80/)
- [Test Assembly Code]()
- [Emulator ROM Implementation]()
